# Understanding Promise.all in JavaScript

## What is Promise.all?
Promise.all is a static method that takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that either fulfills when all input promises have fulfilled or rejects when any of the input promises rejects. It's crucial for handling multiple asynchronous operations that need to be executed in parallel.

## Syntax
```javascript
Promise.all(iterable)
```
The method takes one argument:
- `iterable`: An iterable (such as an Array) of promises or values
- Returns: A Promise that resolves to an array of results

## When to Use Promise.all
1. When executing multiple independent asynchronous operations simultaneously
2. When all operations must complete before proceeding with further execution
3. When maintaining the order of results is important
4. When parallel execution can improve performance

Common use cases include:
- Fetching data from multiple API endpoints simultaneously
- Loading multiple files or resources in parallel
- Performing multiple database operations at once
- Waiting for multiple user actions to complete

## How Promise.all Works
1. Takes an array of promises as input
2. Returns a single promise that resolves with an array of results
3. Results array maintains the same order as input promises
4. If any promise rejects, the entire operation rejects immediately
5. Non-promise values in the input array are automatically wrapped in resolved promises

## Polyfill Explanation Step by Step

### Step 1: Promise Creation and Input Validation
- Create a new Promise wrapper to handle the entire operation
- Validate input to ensure it's an array using Array.isArray()
- If validation fails, reject with TypeError
- This ensures proper error handling for invalid inputs

### Step 2: Initial Setup and State Management
- Initialize an array to store the resolved values
- Create a counter to track completed promises
- Handle the empty array edge case by resolving immediately
- These preparations ensure proper tracking and edge case handling

### Step 3: Promise Processing
- Iterate through each promise in the input array
- Use Promise.resolve to handle both promise and non-promise values
- This ensures uniform handling of all input types
- Maintain the original order using array indices

### Step 4: Result Collection and Tracking
- Store each resolved value in the results array
- Track progress using a completion counter
- Use array indices to preserve the input order
- This ensures results match the order of input promises

### Step 5: Resolution Management
- Monitor the completion count against total promises
- Resolve the main promise when all individual promises complete
- Ensure all results are collected before final resolution
- This guarantees all promises complete before returning

### Step 6: Error Handling and Rejection
- Implement catch blocks for each promise
- Reject immediately if any promise fails
- Stop processing on first rejection (fail-fast behavior)
- Maintain proper error propagation

## Key Features of the Polyfill
- Parallel execution of all promises
- Order preservation of results
- Immediate rejection on any failure
- Proper handling of non-promise values
- Edge case handling for empty arrays
- Type checking and validation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Not handling rejections properly
2. Assuming sequential execution
3. Ignoring the order of results
4. Forgetting to handle non-promise values
5. Not considering the fail-fast behavior
