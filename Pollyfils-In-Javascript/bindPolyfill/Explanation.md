## What is `bind`?

1. **Function Binding**  
   - `bind` is a method used to create a new function with a specific `this` value and optional initial arguments.  
   - The new function created by `bind` can be called later with the specified context and arguments.  
   - The `bind` method **does not** invoke the function immediately; it simply returns a new function.

### How is `bind` Different from `call`?

1. **Invocation Timing**
  * `bind`: Does not invoke the function immediately. It returns a new function that can be invoked later with the specified context and arguments.
  * `call`: Invokes the function immediately with the specified context and arguments.

2. **Return Value**
  * `bind`: Returns a new function that is bound to the specified context.
  * `call`: Returns the result of invoking the function immediately with the specified context and arguments.

3. **Use Case**
  * `bind`: Best used when you need to create a function that will be executed later, with a specific `this` value and initial arguments.
  * `call`: Best used when you need to invoke the function immediately, but with a specific `this` value and arguments.

4. **Argument Handling**
  * `bind`: Allows partial application by passing some arguments during binding.
  * `call`: Requires all arguments to be passed at the time of invocation.

## Conceptual Breakdown

The key distinction lies in their fundamental purpose:
- `bind()` is about creating a new function with a predetermined context
- `call()` is about executing a function immediately with a specific context

## Explanation of the `myBind` Polyfill

1. **Function Type Validation**  
   - Ensure the method is called on a valid function.  
   - If the context (`this`) is not a function, throw a `TypeError`.  
   - This prevents misuse and mimics the behavior of the native `bind` method.

2. **Temporary Method Attachment**  
   - Attach the function (`this`) as a temporary method (`tempFunc`) on the `thisContext` object.  
   - This allows the function to be invoked with the proper context when the bound function is later called.

3. **Return a New Function**  
   - Return a new function that, when called, invokes the original function (`tempFunc`).  
   - The returned function uses the `call` method (indirectly through `tempFunc`) to ensure the correct `this` context.

4. **Argument Handling**  
   - Combine the arguments passed to `myBind` (`args`) with the arguments passed when calling the returned function (`otherArgs`).  
   - This allows flexibility by passing both predefined and additional arguments when invoking the bound function.

5. **Return Result of Function Invocation**  
   - The bound function calls the original function with the correct context and arguments.  
   - If the `return` keyword is included, it ensures the result of the function call is returned to the caller of the bound function. Without it, the result is not returned, and `undefined` is implicitly returned.
